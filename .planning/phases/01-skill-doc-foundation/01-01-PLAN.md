  truths:
    - "An agent reading the first lines of ERC8004-SKILL.md knows it teaches ERC-8004 signing and verification, is for AI agents, and requires only web fetch"
    - "An agent can list all H2 headings to build a navigable table of contents — every section has a noun-phrase H2 title"

<objective>
Create ERC8004-SKILL.md with the document skeleton: H1 title, capability declaration, scope statement (covers / does not cover), and the full H2/H3 heading structure that later plans will fill in.

Purpose: Establishes the machine-navigable document structure that all subsequent phases depend on. An agent can immediately understand what the document teaches and what it excludes.

Output: `public/ERC8004-SKILL.md` with populated top sections and placeholder headings for later content.

  <name>Task 1: Create ERC8004-SKILL.md with capability declaration, scope, and heading skeleton</name>
  <files>public/ERC8004-SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
Create `public/ERC8004-SKILL.md` with the following structure and content:

**H1 title:** `# ERC8004-SKILL: Agent Signing and Verification`

**## Capability** (SKILL-01)
One-sentence declaration: This document teaches AI agents to sign and verify ERC-8004 content on Arbitrum using only web fetch (HTTP requests) — no cryptographic libraries required.
- State who it is for: AI agents
- State assumed tools: web fetch only
- Terse, RFC-like tone per user decision. No conceptual introduction.

**## Scope** (SKILL-03)
Two subsections:

"This document covers:" — bullet list:
- Signed block format (field grammar, required vs optional)
- Agent identity format (eip155 full ID)
- Signing instructions (tool interface, output format, display rules)
- Verification procedure (JSON-RPC calls, address comparison)
- Error conditions and trust forwarding

"This document does not cover:" — bullet list:
- keccak256 or content hash computation
- ERC-8004 registry deployment
- Wallet creation or management
- Library/SDK usage (ethers, viem, web3.py)
- Trust scoring or reputation systems

**Remaining H2/H3 headings as placeholders** (SKILL-02) — these are empty sections with only the heading, to be filled by Plan 02 and later phases:

```
## Signed Block Format
### Fields
### Example: Required Fields Only
### Example: All Fields

## Agent Identity
### Format
### Field Breakdown
### Supported Chains

## Signing Instructions
### Tool Interface
### Output Format
### Display Rules

## Verification Procedure

## Result

## Error Conditions

## Trust Forwarding
```

Each placeholder section should contain a single HTML comment `<!-- Phase N -->` indicating which phase fills it (Phase 1 for Signed Block Format / Agent Identity / Signing Instructions; Phase 2 for Verification Procedure; Phase 3 for Result / Error Conditions / Trust Forwarding).

Voice: Terse spec tone throughout. No hand-holding, no "welcome" language, no conceptual introductions. The Capability section is one sentence followed by a short constraint line. The Scope section is two bullet lists and nothing else.
  </action>
  <verify>
Verify the file exists and has the correct structure:

1. `test -f public/ERC8004-SKILL.md` — file exists
2. Check H1 title is present: grep for `# ERC8004-SKILL`
3. Check all required H2 headings exist: `## Capability`, `## Scope`, `## Signed Block Format`, `## Agent Identity`, `## Signing Instructions`, `## Verification Procedure`, `## Result`, `## Error Conditions`, `## Trust Forwarding`
4. Check H3 headings under Signed Block Format: `### Fields`, `### Example: Required Fields Only`, `### Example: All Fields`
5. Check H3 headings under Agent Identity: `### Format`, `### Field Breakdown`, `### Supported Chains`
6. Check H3 headings under Signing Instructions: `### Tool Interface`, `### Output Format`, `### Display Rules`
7. Verify `## Capability` section contains "web fetch" and "no cryptographic libraries"
8. Verify `## Scope` section contains "does not cover" with keccak256, registry deployment, wallet management
  </verify>
  <done>
- ERC8004-SKILL.md exists at public/ERC8004-SKILL.md
- Capability declaration states what, who, and assumed tools in one sentence
- Scope lists both what is covered and what is not covered
- All 9 H2 headings present with noun-phrase titles
- All 9 H3 sub-headings present under the three Phase 1 H2 sections
- Placeholder sections have phase comments
- Terse spec tone throughout — no hand-holding prose
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- File exists at `public/ERC8004-SKILL.md`
- `grep -c "^## " public/ERC8004-SKILL.md` returns 9 (nine H2 headings)
- `grep -c "^### " public/ERC8004-SKILL.md` returns 9 (nine H3 headings)
- First non-blank line after `## Capability` mentions "web fetch" and "AI agents"
- `## Scope` section contains both "covers:" and "does not cover:"
- No mention of ai.html anywhere in the file

<success_criteria>
An agent reading only the Capability and Scope sections of ERC8004-SKILL.md can determine: (1) the document teaches signing and verification, (2) it assumes only web fetch, (3) keccak256/deployment/wallets are out of scope. An agent listing H2 headings gets a complete navigable index of the document.
